## REVIEW COMMENTS:
# MODEL_LINK_IDS ARE GP LANES. THESE DON'T NEED TO BE CHANGED
# ADDING A 1 TO THE LEFT OF EACH LINK ID, since the managed lanes are coded with a 1 to the left of the parallel links
# DELETING 2225072 (OR 12225072), SINCE IT IS ALREADY CODED AS TOLLBOOTH 32, TOLLSEG 1
# Properties updated would be USECLASS_AM, USECLASS_MD, USECLASS_PM, TOLLBOOTH and TOLLSEG, probably not ML_USECLASS and ML_TOLLSEG
# TOLLBOOTH value set to 32 to be consistent, TOLLSEG value set to 2 to distinguish it from the existing one.
