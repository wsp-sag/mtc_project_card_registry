## REVIEW COMMENTS:
# MODEL_LINK_IDS ARE GP LANES. THESE DON'T NEED TO BE CHANGED
# ADDING A 1 TO THE LEFT OF EACH LINK ID, since the managed lanes are coded with a 1 to the left of the parallel links
# DELETING 2238264 (OR 12238264), SINCE IT IS not in the project extent
# DELETING 2029841 (OR 12029841), SINCE it is already coded as TOLLBOOTH 31 and TOLLSEG 1
# Properties updated would be USECLASS, TOLLBOOTH and TOLLSEG, probably not ML_USECLASS and ML_TOLLSEG
# TOLLBOOTH value set to 31 to be consistent, TOLLSEG value set to 2 to distinguish it from the existing one.
